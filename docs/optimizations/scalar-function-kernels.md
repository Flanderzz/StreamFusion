# Scalar function allocation and text scans

These techniques describe the current function kernels inside native Calc. The
[scalar function benchmark page](../benchmarks/scalar-functions.md) reports Flink and native
complete-job results for the same workloads, including both row/Arrow transposes. Those
measurements do not isolate kernel cost, and native admission does not guarantee a speedup
for each standalone query.

The optional Criterion `scalar_functions` benchmark invokes production UDFs on 4,096-row Arrow
arrays, including scalar adaptation, NULL handling, and result allocation. Input creation,
planner coercion, JNI, and transposes are excluded from that diagnostic:

```sh
cargo bench --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml --features mimalloc --bench scalar_functions
```

Run one benchmark at a time. Kernel diagnostics and complete SQL jobs measure different work.

## LOCATE

The two-argument form reverses operands into DataFusion strpos. The three-argument Rust kernel follows DataFusion's batch ASCII detection, one reusable memmem::Finder for literal needles, and memmem searches for column needles. Constant needles/starts stay scalar, following Comet's contains pattern. Shared positioning code preserves Flink's empty-needle and signed-start rules; no JVM callback is added.
